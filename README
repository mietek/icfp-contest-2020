This project is based on starter kit for Haskell.

Then, we've added REPL implementation in JS. Use it by opening the [HTML file](repl/index.html) in your browser. Run tests with `node repl/repl.js`.

Then, we've changed the server implementation to Python. Install deps with:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run tests with `python -m pytest .'`
